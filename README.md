Just [my](https://github.com/simison) humble little website.

## Dev
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) setup based on [OctoPress](http://octopress.org/) 3.0.
* With some modifications such as Bower, NPM, Grunt... follows quite a lot of [this setup](http://www.aymerick.com/2014/07/22/jekyll-github-pages-bower-bootstrap.html).

Instead of `jekyll serve` you should run `grunt` (or for very verbose output `grunt -v`) and now you'll have site running at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

To simply build stuff, run `grunt build`.
